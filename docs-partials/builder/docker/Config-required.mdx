- `commit` (bool) - If true, the container will be committed to an image rather than exported.
  Default `false`. If `commit` is `false`, then either `discard` must be
  set to `true` or an `export_path` must be provided.

- `discard` (bool) - Throw away the container when the build is complete. This is useful for
  the [artifice
  post-processor](/packer/docs/post-processors/artifice).

- `export_path` (string) - The path where the final container will be exported as a tar file.

- `image` (string) - The base image for the Docker container that will be started. This image
  will be pulled from the Docker registry if it doesn't already exist.
  Any value format that you can provide to `docker pull` is valid.
  Example: `ubuntu` or `ubuntu:xenial`. If you only provide the repo, Docker
  will pull the latest image, so setting `ubuntu` is the same as setting
  `ubuntu:latest`. You can also set a distribution digest. For example,
  ubuntu@sha256:a0d9e826ab87bd665cfc640598a871b748b4b70a01a4f3d174d4fb02adad07a9

- `message` (string) - Set a message for the commit.
