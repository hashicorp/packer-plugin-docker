- `commit` (bool) - If true, the container will be committed to an image rather than exported.
  Default `false`. If `commit` is `false`, then either `discard` must be
  set to `true` or an `export_path` must be provided.

- `discard` (bool) - Throw away the container when the build is complete. This is useful for
  the [artifice
  post-processor](/packer/docs/post-processors/artifice).

- `export_path` (string) - The path where the final container will be exported as a tar file.

- `message` (string) - Set a message for the commit.
