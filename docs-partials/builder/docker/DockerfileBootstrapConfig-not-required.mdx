- `build_dir` (string) - Directory to invoke `docker build` from
  
  Defaults to the directory from which we invoke packer.

- `arguments` (map[string]string) - A mapping of additional build args to provide. The key of
  the object is the argument name, the value is the argument value.

- `platform` (string) - Set platform if server is multi-platform capable

- `pull` (boolean) - Pull the image when building the base docker image.
  
  Note: defaults to true, to disable this, explicitly set it to false.

- `compress` (bool) - Compress the build context before sending to the docker daemon.
  
  This is especially useful if the build context is large, as copying it
  can take a significant amount of time, while once compressed, this
  can make builds faster, at the price of extra CPU resources.
