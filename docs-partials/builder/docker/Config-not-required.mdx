<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/docker/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `build` (DockerfileBootstrapConfig) - Configuration for a bootstrap image derived from a Dockerfile
  
  Specifying this will make the builder run `docker build` on a provided
  Dockerfile, and this image will then be used to perform the rest of
  the build process.
  
  For more information on the contents of this object, refer to the
  [Bootstrapping a build with a Dockerfile](#bootstrapping-a-build-with-a-dockerfile)
  section of this documentation.

- `author` (string) - Set the author (e-mail) of a commit.

- `changes` ([]string) - Dockerfile instructions to add to the commit. Example of instructions
  are CMD, ENTRYPOINT, ENV, and EXPOSE. Example: [ "USER ubuntu", "WORKDIR
  /app", "EXPOSE 8080" ]

- `container_dir` (string) - The directory inside container to mount temp directory from host server
  for work [file provisioner](/packer/docs/provisioners/file). This defaults
  to c:/packer-files on windows and /packer-files on other systems.

- `device` ([]string) - An array of devices which will be accessible in container when it's run
  without `--privileged` flag.

- `cap_add` ([]string) - An array of additional [Linux
  capabilities](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities)
  to grant to the container.

- `cap_drop` ([]string) - An array of [Linux
  capabilities](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities)
  to drop from the container.

- `docker_path` (string) - Sets the docker binary to use for running commands.
  
  If you want to use a specific version of the docker binary, or a
  docker alternative for building your container, you can specify this
  through this option.
  **Note**: if using an alternative like `podman`, not all options are
  equivalent, and the build may fail in this case.
  
  Defaults to "docker"

- `exec_user` (string) - Username (UID) to run remote commands with. You can also set the group
  name/ID if you want: (UID or UID:GID). You may need this if you get
  permission errors trying to run the shell or other provisioners.

- `image` (string) - The base image for the Docker container that will be started. This image
  will be pulled from the Docker registry if it doesn't already exist.
  Any value format that you can provide to `docker pull` is valid.
  Example: `ubuntu` or `ubuntu:xenial`. If you only provide the repo, Docker
  will pull the latest image, so setting `ubuntu` is the same as setting
  `ubuntu:latest`. You can also set a distribution digest. For example,
  ubuntu@sha256:a0d9e826ab87bd665cfc640598a871b748b4b70a01a4f3d174d4fb02adad07a9
  
  This cannot be used at the same time as `build`

- `privileged` (bool) - If true, run the docker container with the `--privileged` flag. This
  defaults to false if not set.

- `runtime` (string) - Set the container runtime. A runtime different from the one installed
  by default with Docker (`runc`) must be installed and configured.
  The possible values are (non-exhaustive list):
  `runsc` for [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/),
  `kata-runtime` for [Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/),
  `sysbox-runc` for [Nestybox](https://www.nestybox.com/).

- `pull` (bool) - If true, the configured image will be pulled using `docker pull` prior
  to use. Otherwise, it is assumed the image already exists and can be
  used. This defaults to true if not set.
  
  If using `build`, this field will be ignored, as the `pull` option for
  this operation will instead have precedence.

- `run_command` ([]string) - An array of arguments to pass to docker run in order to run the
  container. By default this is set to `["-d", "-i", "-t",
  "--entrypoint=/bin/sh", "--", "{{.Image}}"]` if you are using a linux
  container, and `["-d", "-i", "-t", "--entrypoint=powershell", "--",
  "{{.Image}}"]` if you are running a windows container. `{{.Image}}` is a
  template variable that corresponds to the image template option. Passing
  the entrypoint option this way will make it the default entrypoint of
  the resulting image, so running docker run -it --rm  will start the
  docker image from the /bin/sh shell interpreter; you could run a script
  or another shell by running docker run -it --rm  -c /bin/bash. If your
  docker image embeds a binary intended to be run often, you should
  consider changing the default entrypoint to point to it.

- `tmpfs` ([]string) - An array of additional tmpfs volumes to mount into this container.

- `volumes` (map[string]string) - A mapping of additional volumes to mount into this container. The key of
  the object is the host path, the value is the container path.

- `fix_upload_owner` (bool) - If true, files uploaded to the container will be owned by the user the
  container is running as. If false, the owner will depend on the version
  of docker installed in the system. Defaults to true.

- `windows_container` (bool) - If "true", tells Packer that you are building a Windows container
  running on a windows host. This is necessary for building Windows
  containers, because our normal docker bindings do not work for them.

- `platform` (string) - Set platform if server is multi-platform capable
  
  If using `build`, this field will be ignored, as the `platform` option for
  this operation will instead have precedence.

- `login` (bool) - This is used to login to dockerhub to pull a private base container. For
  pushing to dockerhub, see the docker post-processors

- `login_password` (string) - The password to use to authenticate to login.

- `login_server` (string) - The server address to login to.

- `login_username` (string) - The username to use to authenticate to login.

- `ecr_login` (bool) - Defaults to false. If true, the builder will login in order to pull the
  image from Amazon EC2 Container Registry (ECR). The builder only logs in
  for the duration of the pull. If true login_server is required and
  login, login_username, and login_password will be ignored. For more
  information see the section on ECR.
